# Titan MCP Orchestration

When generating UI through Cursor + MCP for this repository, follow this order:

1. Use `react-aria-components` primitives as behavioral/accessibility base.
2. Paint with Titan semantic tokens/foundations.
3. Reuse `titan-aria` wrappers when they avoid rework and keep parity.
4. For icons, use `lucide-react`.

## Component ownership model (current context)

- `AriaBase`: component built from `react-aria-components` + Titan tokens/foundations.
- `TitanAriaWrapper`: existing wrapper from `packages/titan-aria` used as compatibility accelerator.
- `FoundationSpec`: JSON/doc spec only; not a productized component runtime.

## Implementation notes

- `Navbar`, `Menu`, `Select`, and `Drawer` must resolve as `AriaBase` or `TitanAriaWrapper`.
- Local specs/docs are active references for generation consistency, not deprecated placeholders.

## Non-collision rule

- Never output two active implementations for the same component in one solution.
- If using a temporary path, mark it as `snowflake` and include migration trigger.
